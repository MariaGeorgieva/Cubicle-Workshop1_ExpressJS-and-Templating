Although it’s the same overall cube-y shape we’ve come to know and love, this one (nicknamed the Black Magic cube) is known as a shape-mod cube. It’s a super pick if you’re looking for a model with a challenging (and visually stunning) design.",

    "description": "Feeling overwhelmed by some of the other options on this list? Don’t be! The simpler 2×2 Speed Cube from D-FantiX is a less daunting starting place. It still has the same number of faces as the traditional 3×3 cube but fewer blocks to line up. The cube also ditches stickers and features a frosted surface with a bright color scheme that’s easier to distinguish (and it’ll last longer, as stickers can fade). It even offers adjustable tension and is pre-lubricated and tensioned for smoother operation.",
